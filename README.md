To run bash on windows: use Windows subsystem for linux (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-your-linux-username-and-password)
Install Ubuntu on WSL throught terminal
Set up user name and password for linux subsystem
Run bash scripts in the mounted folder from the windows system

To start WSL after install:

run wsl in command prompt or powershell (running bash also seems to work)
